# Java Compiler

This is a Java Compiler I built for my College Compiler course with other two classmate in 1997 two years after Java 1.0 was release. In 1998 I continued to work alone on this compiler for my thesis extending it with some research on compilers. The compiler was able to take in input .java file and convert it in .class in order to be run on a JVM (basically the job done by javac program). The compiler run a lot of example programs using several Java Apis. It was also able to run several Applet in a Netscape (the father of Mozilla Firefox) browser.

In 2017 I found this code on an old floppy disk in a drawer of my old desk. To avoid to lost it forever I decided to copy it on my Github profile. I tried to compile it again with modern C++ compiler but the task wasn't that easy. For this reason I decided to keep it as it is for future memory. If someday I'll decide to try to make it working again and I'll be successful I'll update this page.
